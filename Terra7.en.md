# Terra7
 ✨ _For Atari 2600_ ✨

Game Rules
----------------
Terra7 is under attack.
The only way to stop the invading horde is to activate the satellite with the laser.
Satellite that only comes into operation when it arrives at the set position, towards the end of the screen
and only if the 10 batteries have been charged.
The more enemies you destroy, the more technicians remain on Terra7 to work on battery charging procedures.
For every 25 enemies destroyed one battery is recharged.
The total number of enemies to be destroyed is therefore 250.
The robot you manoeuvre has 5 shields and cannot have more than this.
You lose a shield every time
- you are hit by a missile
- you collide with an enemy spaceship
- you collide with an asteroid
- you collide with the SmartBomb (S symbol)
- you do not rescue an astronaut lost in space
- you accidentally kill the astronaut lost in space

You gain a shield when you collide with the Energy Module (E symbol)
If you hit the Energy Module with your bazooka, you gain nothing.

If you hit the SmartBomb, everything on the screen is destroyed.
You automatically increase the counter of enemies killed by 3,
regardless of what's on the screen.

Whether the mission succeeds or fails, the game ends.
